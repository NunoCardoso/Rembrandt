[[41]edit] Biography

   Born on [42]11 July [43]1864 in Nikolaevka (not far away from [44]Varna,
   [45]Bulgaria). The third child of priest Constantin Deunovski and Dobra
   Georgieva. His grandfather on his mother's side was Atanas Georgiev
   (1805-1865), an active public figure in the struggle for the independence
   of the church during the Revival in Bulgarian nation (18-19
   century).^[[46]citation needed] His father, Constantin Deunovski
   (1830-1918) was the first Bulgarian teacher and priest in Varna.

   In 1872 Peter Deunov was admitted to an elementary school and he graduated
   secondary school in Varna after the liberation of Bulgaria from the
   [47]Ottoman Empire. On [48]24 June [49]1886 he completed his studies at
   the American School of [50]Theology in Svishtov and was a teacher in
   Hotantsa, near [51]Rousse, from the autumn of 1887 to the summer of 1888.

   In August 1888 he left for the USA. He enrolled at the [52]Drew
   Theological Methodist Seminary in [53]Madison, [54]New Jersey and
   completed his studies there in May 1892. During the autumn of 1892 he
   enrolled at the [55]Boston University School of Theology, defended a
   graduation paper on "The Migration of the Germanic Tribes and Their
   Christianisation" and obtained his degree in June 1893. He was a regular
   student at the School of Medicine of the [56]Boston University for one
   year.

   In 1895 Deunov returned to Bulgaria, settled in Varna and refused the
   positions offered to him as Methodist and Theosophic preacher. In 1896 he
   published Science and Education, [57][1] in which he analyzed the
   development of humankind in the dramatic world events and wrote about the
   foundations of a new culture which he thought was bound to take place
   during the coming century.

   In 1896 he was one of the founders of the "P. R. Slaveikov" community and
   cultural centre. He was appointed a librarian and during the subsequent
   years he delivered the following lectures before the citizens of Varna:
   "The Origin of Man", "Survey of Ancient and Modern Philosophy", "Science
   and Philosophy", "Why and How We Live" and "The Basis of Enlightenment".

   In 1897 Peter Deunov, together with some of his followers in Varna,
   founded a "Society for the Elevation of the Religious Spirit of the
   Bulgarian People", with the following members: Dr. Georgi Mirkovich, Maria
   Kazakova, Todor Stoyanov, Penyu Kirov, Anastassia Jelyazkova and Milkon
   Partomyan. He published the brochure of mystic texts in the same year
   under the title of "Hio-Eli-Meli-Mesail". The events from 1897 placed him
   at the centre of the spiritual society, which later on developed into a
   Synarchic Chain (1906) and into the Universal White Brotherhood (1918),
   while he himself was distinguished like individuality with the byname of
   Master. Actually after 1897 it is much more appropriate to refer to him as
   "Master Beinsa Douno", rather than as "Peter Deunov", although the byname
   of "Beinsa Douno" gained currency in literary publications only in the
   1930s. The etymology of the name of "Beinsa Douno" has [58]Sanskrit roots
   and translates as The One Who Brings in the Good through the Word.

   In 1898 he wrote and delivered the lecture, An Appeal to My People
   (Nation), [59][2] before the "Mother" Charity Society in Varna. This
   lecture is an appeal to social and spiritual self-identification. During
   the following year he recorded "The Ten Testimonies of God and The Divine
   Promise". From 1899 Master Beinsa Douno convened Annual Meetings in Varna,
   which were originally called Meetings of the Synarchic Chain. From then
   onwards until 1942 the Universal White Brotherhood held its Annual
   Meetings at various places every year in August: in Varna (1899-1909), in
   [60]Veliko Tarnovo (1910-1925), in [61]Sofia (1926-1941), in the Rila and
   Vitosha mountains.

   From 1901 to 1912 he travelled to various places in Bulgaria, delivered
   lectures and did [62]phrenologic investigations of selected individuals
   among the people. He started delivering his lectures in public. The
   historic, cosmic and metaphysical figure of Christ has a central place in
   his lectures. In 1912, in the village of Arbanassi (near Veliko Tarnovo)
   he worked on the Bible and prepared The Testament of the Colour Rays of
   Light, which came out in September during the same year. The title page
   had a motto: "I will always be a faithful slave to Lord Jesus Christ - the
   Son of God, 15 Aug 1912, Tarnovo."

   On [63]16 March [64]1914 he delivered his first Sunday talk, which was
   officially taken in shorthand with title [65]Behold the Man, which laid
   the beginning of the Power and Life series. Master Beinsa Douno postulated
   the main principles of his teaching, which he called The New Teaching of
   the Universal White Brotherhood. On [66]8 February [67]1917 in Sofia he
   started a series of special lectures for married women, which lasted until
   [68]30 June [69]1932. During 1917-1918, at the time of the [70]First World
   War, the government of Vassil Radoslavov sent him in exile to Varna under
   the pretext that his teaching was weakening the spirit of the soldiers at
   the front. He lived in the London Hotel (currently the Moussala Hotel) and
   was in correspondence with his followers. After the end of the First World
   War in 1918 the number of his followers all over the country started
   growing rapidly and they reached a peak near 40,000 people in the late
   1930s.^[71][2]

   On [72]24 February [73]1922 he opened an Esoteric School in Sofia, which
   he called School of the Universal White Brotherhood. It consisted of two
   classes of students. The General Esoteric Class opened with a lecture
   titled The Three Lives, [74][3] and the Special (Youth) Esoteric Class
   with The Two Paths. [75][4] Lectures were delivered before the two
   esoteric classes every week for 22 years -- until December 1944.

   In 1927 Master Beinsa Douno established the settlement of [76]Izgrev near
   Sofia (today a residential area of the city) where he gathered his
   audience, followers and disciples to have a centre where the esoteric
   school worked. He settled permanently in Izgrev, where he delivered the
   various series of his Word. From [77]19 August [78]1927 he delivered a
   series of lectures at the annual meeting of the Universal White
   Brotherhood, comprising into the cycle with title The Path of a Disciple.

   During the period 1929-1932 Master Beinsa Douno established contact with
   the [79]Theosophic leader [80]Jiddu Krishnamurti (in the town of Ommen,
   the [81]Netherlands), who left the [82]Theosophical Society at that time
   and dissolved the [83]Order of the Star in the East.

   In the summer of 1929 he took his followers and disciples camping near
   [84]the Seven Rila Lakes for the first time. On [85]21 September [86]1930
   he opened a new series of his teaching, called the Sunday Morning
   lectures, which lasted until April 1944. From 1934 he started working on
   the [87]Paneurhythmy - a series of twenty-eight exercises consisting of
   melody, text and plastic movements. Later on he added the exercises The
   Sun Rays and Pentagram.

   On [88]4 May [89]1936 he was beaten by an adherent to a political party,
   causing brain hemorrhage and paralysis. In spite of his health problem, on
   [90]14 July Master Beinsa Douno went out camping with followers of his
   near the Seven Rila Lakes and he had recovered completely by [91]12
   August.

   On [92]22 March [93]1939 he wrote a message to his disciples titled The
   Eternal Testament of Spirit.

   In the early 1944 during the air raids in Sofia he organized the
   evacuation of Izgrev to Marchaevo (a village not far from Sofia) while he
   stayed at the home of one of his disciples. He returned to Izgrev on
   [94]19 October [95]1944. On [96]20 December [97]1944 he delivered his last
   lecture The Last Word to the General Esoteric Class.

   He died on [98]27 December [99]1944. His body was laid in Izgrev.

[[100]edit] Creative contribution

  [[101]edit] Ideological and methodological doctrine

   The various aspects in the Teaching of Master Beinsa Douno are set out and
   developed in about 7000 lectures of his, delivered and put down in short
   hand in the period of 1900-1944. They were published in several
   multi-volume series: lectures before the General Esoteric Class, lectures
   before the Special Esoteric Class, Sunday lectures, Annual Meeting
   lectures, Morning lectures etc.

   The main categories in his Teaching are: [102]Love, [103]Wisdom,
   [104]Truth, [105]Justice and [106]Virtue, understood as attributes of the
   historic, cosmic and mystic [107]Christ. [108]Love is a central macro- and
   micro-cosmic category, functioning in the various aspects of human
   existence as aspiration (in the emotional sphere or the heart), feeling
   (in the soul), power (in the ideal sphere of the `I' or the mind) and
   principle (in the spirit). The so-called Great Universal Brotherhood is
   the fundamental cosmogonist view. It is described as an organism,
   consisting of advanced human souls (lodges of the Great Initiated and
   their disciples) and the nine hierarchies of super-sensitive beings
   (angels, archangels, principalities, powers, mights, dominions, thrones,
   cherubim and seraphim). According to Master Beinsa Douno, Christ is the
   supreme governor of the Great Universal Brotherhood.

   The history of world culture is seen as projection of a cosmic rhythm,
   structured in global periods and sub-periods. The periods are as follows:
   Polar, Hyperborean, Lemurian, Atlantis, the Fifth, the Sixth and the
   Seventh Periods. The sub-periods of the current Fifth Period are also
   called cultural epochs: the epoch of the Cancer (Ancient-Indian), the
   Gemini (Ancient-Persian), Taurus (Ancient-Egyptan), Aries (Ancient Greece
   and Rome), Pisces (Western European), Aquarius (Slavonic) etc. Human
   consciousness manifests itself and develops through collective,
   individual, supreme collective and cosmic stages. According to Master
   Beinsa Douno humankind is entering the epoch of Aquarius from 1914
   onwards, i.e. implementation of the evolutionary transition from the Fifth
   to the Sixth cultural epochs within the Fifth Period. During this period,
   according to Master Beinsa Douno the Indo-European race is a leader in an
   evolutionary aspect. The first steps into the supreme collective
   consciousness are being made during the current transition stage. One of
   its social forms was achieved through the supreme aspects of Love - life
   for the Whole. The extended collective consciousness, implementing the
   life of the Whole, is regarded as an attribute of the forthcoming Sixth
   (Slavonic) cultural epoch and of the future Sixth race stemming from it.
   According to Master Beinsa Douno, the Sixth race will manifest itself in
   the future Sixth big period and will implement the culture of Love to a
   much greater scope.

   The psychological aspect of the human development according to Master
   Beinsa Douno is a consequential transformation through four cultural
   archetypes: "Old Testament", "New Testament", the "Righteous" and
   "Disciple". The transition to the latter is understood as a totality of
   esoteric school methods, aimed at the transformation of the
   ideal-conceptual consciousness into imaginative and is designated by the
   term of [109]"blossoming of the human soul". According to Master Beinsa
   Douno esoteric disciples link their [110]consciousness with Christ
   permanently, experience Him constantly in their mental, emotional and
   will-power spheres and learn permanently from what He performs within
   them. Thus the [111]consciousness of disciple and his [112]etheric body
   more specifically, is naturally perceived as object and subject of the
   so-called '[113]Second Coming of Christ.

   The main methods for spiritual work in the School of the Universal White
   Brotherhood are: prayer gatherings, musical and respiratory exercises,
   reading of the Word of Master Beinsa Douno, greeting the sunrise, outings
   in the mountains, life in brotherhood communities, annual meetings etc.
   The special methods are "The Testament of the Colour Rays of Light" and
   the "[114]Paneurhythmy" dance.^[115][3] All the methods are considered
   esoteric practices for experiencing Christ through the wholeness of the
   human being and more precisely through the human etheric body.

  [[116]edit] Philosophical contribution

   The contribution is formulated as ideas in various fields of philosophy.
   Developed in numerous lectures of Master Beinsa Douno, these are subject
   to analysis and interpretation from now on. Some of the ideas in the
   philosophical domain are as follows:

     * "Your [117]consciousness can travel at the speed of slow trains, it
       can travel at the speed of Light, and it can travel even faster.
       Hence, time and space are functions of consciousness. Consciousness is
       out of the scope of time and space..." (Youth Esoteric Class, year 1,
       lecture 13, Contradictions in Life, [118]24 May [119]1922)
     * "Contemporary people still cannot imagine that Light is living. We
       live in a living Light, while the Light that physics discuss,
       represents the sub-consciousness of the living Light. The same phases
       can be found in the consciousness of Light like the phases in your
       consciousness - sub-consciousness, [120]self-consciousness and
       [121]super-consciousness." [not in Freud meaning - Editors note]
       (Youth Esoteric Class, year IV, lecture 25, Influence of the Inner
       Light, [122]12 April [123]1925)
     * "One can identify whether there are beings on the Sun by the light of
       the Solar [124]spectrum. Above all, wherever there is intelligent
       life, Light comes in a special way... There is a difference in the
       spreading of the Sun rays coming out from a un-intelligent being [or
       non-living object] and those coming out from an intelligent being -
       the laws are different." (Youth Esoteric Class, year IV, lecture 15,
       The Tests of a Disciple. The Wheat Grain, [125]25 January [126]1925)
     * "People want to attribute a certain form to God, but I ask the
       question what form can you attribute to Light? Light itself creates
       forms. How does it create forms? As soon as it encounters an obstacle,
       it already creates a certain form. ... Make the environment of your
       thoughts rarer or denser and they will immediately experience some
       refraction." (Youth Esoteric Class, year I, lecture 5, Old and New
       Lives, ([127]29 March [128]1922)
     * "The first process, which is the beginning of will, is restricting.
       Without any restrictions the will cannot be manifested. Above all, the
       will presupposes a strictly determined movement in the consciousness,
       i.e. an inclination of consciousness" (Youth Esoteric Class, year I,
       lecture 4, Characteristics and Manifestation of the Will, [129]15
       March [130]1922)
     * "The more advanced the evolution of a certain form [of life] is, the
       more intelligent the atoms comprising it. In order to reach a higher
       stage of development, the atom has to pass through the four Kingdoms -
       the mineral kingdom, the plant kingdom, the animal kingdom and the
       kingdom of human beings. ...The more stable the atoms of given
       elements in the human organism are, the better characteristics they
       convey to human character." (Youth Esoteric Class, year V, lecture 13,
       Real Variables, [131]1 February [132]1926)

  [[133]edit] Esoteric scientific work

   During the period 1901-1912 Master Beinsa Douno carried out
   [134]phrenologic research among selected individuals from the Bulgarian
   people. Later on some of the results were stated in his Sunday sermons,
   and the opening of the Esoteric School of the Universal White Brotherhood
   (1922) is an indication of his comprehensive approach to the [135]esoteric
   sciences on self-knowledge - [136]astrology, [137]chiromancy
   [138]palmistry, [139]phrenology, [140]kabbalah etc. His original
   methodology in this area includes the following major principles:

     * Master Beinsa Douno gave an impulse to esoteric disciples to study on
       their own the traditions of some esoteric science, correcting and
       directing the process of learning and research.

     * He forbade the use of esoteric sciences for personal evaluation and
       criticism.

     * He gave an impulse to the so-called evolutionary development of these
       sciences: they should not be approached from an objective and positive
       points of view; they should facilitate the development of virtues in
       the human soul and should assist the birth and knowing of the
       [141]Internal Christ.

     * He used a synthetic approach among different esoteric sciences; for
       instance in order to understand completely the details of a
       [142]horoscope, [143]human palm, [144]face or the [145]phrenologic
       parameters of a skull - one has to consult, summarise and synthesise
       particular results from astrological, chiromantic, physiognomic,
       phrenologic or any other analysis.

   Some ideas and approaches of Master Beinsa Douno in the above-mentioned
   esoteric sciences are utilised by the Varna astrological tradition for the
   creation of the so-called "three-dimensional model of a horoscope" - an
   innovation in the astrological methodology.

  [[146]edit] Musical Works

   Peter Deunov studied music and the violin in 1880s. During the first
   decade of the 20th century Master Beinsa Douno started composing music to
   Biblical texts and to texts written by him, called "brotherly songs" later
   on, and from 1922 he started producing songs and melodies in the two
   esoteric classes of his School, which he called [147]"esoteric musical
   exercises". According to him they were methods for esoteric work and were
   meant to tone up and harmonise the psychic processes going on in esoteric
   disciples. Some of the texts to the musical exercises were written in
   sacred proto-language, which Master Beinsa Douno called Vatan language and
   he defined it as the primary language of humankind.

  [[148]edit] Predictions and Insights

     * "Christ Impulse will gradually penetrate into the human being and will
       take over guidance during the further development of the humankind. We
       are still in the beginning of all this now. In the future Christianity
       - but not the external, official, Christianity, but the mystic,
       Esoteric Christianity - will become a world religion for the whole
       humankind. Christ will be placed in the center of the new culture.
       Remember, that Christ is a manifestation of the love of God. And He
       will come as an internal light in the minds and hearts of the people.
       This light will attract everybody around Christ as a great center. The
       opening of the human minds and hearts and the reception of Christ from
       within - this will be the second appearance of Christ on the Earth. He
       will preach mainly the great science of Love and the methods how to
       apply it. He will preach the Path of discipleship, brotherhood and
       serving. Because this is what the law of evolution requires nowadays."
       (The Master, The Life of the Sixth Race, [149]ISBN 954-744-050-0)

     * "Eight thousand adepts are coming into the world. Some will
       reincarnate, others will be incorporated."

     * "We need to learn the great law that God is our Father, that we have
       to live like brothers, that no one has the right to kill and there can
       be no violence. This is what God wrote and we all have to live
       according to His law. If the contemporary European people do not
       accept Christ's Teaching, in ten years there will be a war worse than
       any other war in human history... And I say, `Christ is coming! If
       people accept Love, war will be cancelled; if they do not accept it,
       there will be a war and then people will experience even greater
       suffering.'" ([150]24 June [151]1923)

     * "There is no epoch in human history when Christ has worked like now.
       Now Christ is working harder than ever. Several centuries ago Christ
       was up there in the supreme worlds, and now He has descended lower,
       into the Astral and Ether Worlds, closer to the material world. Two
       great events will happen: first, the spirit of Christ will start
       implanting into human beings - of course, in the beginning it will
       start implanting into the prepared souls. When you experience a fine,
       unselfish feeling, when you are full of mercy, love, grace, this shows
       that the spirit of Christ has illuminated you and it has started
       working within you. Apostle Paul says as well, does not he, `It's not
       me living, but Christ's spirit implanted in me.'" (Master Beinsa
       Douno, The According of the Human Soul, compiled by Boyan Boev, Sofia,
       2001).
     * "Christ will come, this is beyond doubt, and soon will He come... The
       Second Coming should not be understood to mean the end of the world,
       but the second coming of Christ." ([152]11 August [153]1911).
     * "Christ is working in the world, but the people do not see Him. They
       want to see Him as a human being; they want to touch Him, to
       physically sense Him. If He fills people's hearts with beautiful,
       elevated feelings, what can you desire? ...It's wrong people to expect
       Christ to be born again as a baby. Christ was born and is being born
       in the hearts and souls of people. Christ cannot be born by a woman
       today. If you expect the coming of the Saviour, open your souls. He
       will be born there. Moreover, Christ is being born in many souls at
       the same time. When Christ is born in your soul, you will be useful
       both to yourself and to the people around you. This is Resurrection.
       This is what wakening of the human soul means. When Christ lives in
       the souls of people, everybody will be resurrected; everybody will
       rise and join hands as brothers." ([154]25 March [155]1923).
     * "After the war people will start talking about United European States
       and this idea will be implemented." ([156]1 May [157]1940).

[[160]edit] World response

  [[161]edit] Dissemination of the Teaching of Master Beinsa Douno

   In the 1940s the teaching of Master Beinsa Douno became popular in some
   European countries: [162]France, [163]Lithuania for example, while in
   1970s it was widely spread in [164]Russia, [165]Canada and [166]USA.
   During the 1990s some disciples and followers of him appeared in
   [167]United Kingdom, [168]Germany, [169]Australia and [170]Congo. After
   the democratic changes in Bulgaria, followers of the Universal White
   Brotherhood in Bulgaria registered a non-profit organization at the court
   ([171]"White Brotherhood - Bulgaria", [172]1995), which is governed by a
   Supreme Brotherhood Council having a domicile in Sofia. There are dozens
   of spiritual centres outside the territory of the country, biggest of all
   being the French centre in Bonfin. It was established in 1953 by Mihail
   Ivanov (1900-1986) - a disciple of Master Beinsa Douno, called by his
   followers [173]Omraam Mikhael Aivanhov.

  [[174]edit] Spiritual and cultural influence

   The works and activities of Master Beinsa Douno are subject of research
   and analyses by prominent scientists and spiritual leaders.

     * According to Pavel Biryukov, a biographer of Count Leo N. Tolstoy, the
       great Russian thinker and writer left Yasna Polyana shortly before his
       death (1910) with the intention to travel to Bulgaria to meet Master
       Peter Deunov.

     * Cardinal Giuseppe Roncalli, an Ambassador of the [175]Vatican to
       Bulgaria before the [176]Second World War, elected as [177]Pope John
       XXIII later on, said, `In the present epoch the greatest philosopher
       living on the earth is Peter Deunov.'

     * [178]Rudolf Steiner, the founder of [179]Anthroposophy, said in a
       conversation with Boyan Boev (Munich, 1910): `The Slavonic people are
       destined to have a great mission. They, and particularly Bulgaria,
       will contribute a good deal to the elevation of humankind. Return to
       Bulgaria, there is a powerful spiritual movement in Bulgaria, headed
       by a great spiritual Initiate.' After this conversation Boyan Boev
       became one of the closest disciples of Master Beinsa Douno.

     * [180]Paramahansa Yogananda, when asked while visiting [181]Greece
       about his intentions with regard to establishing an ashram in
       Bulgaria, declared, `This is how far I can go, the Spirit of the Truth
       is active there'.

     * [182]Jiddu Krishnamurti, leader of Theosophic movement refused to be
       declared [183]Maitreya and Christ and told the participants of a World
       Theosophic Congress in the [184]Netherlands that the World Master was
       in Bulgaria.

     * [185]Onisaburo Deguchi, leader of the [186]Oomoto, Japanese spiritual
       movement, said, `I am a wise man, the Master is in Bulgaria.'

     * Alfred Lemonier, professor at the Toulouse University, France, during
       his visit to Bulgaria addressed Master Beinsa Douno with the following
       words, `We came to thank you from the bottom of our soul and spirit,
       and also to request new blessings, advice, example, physical, moral
       and intellectual power from you so that we can serve to the Whole
       better.'

   After 1925 the Teaching of Master Beinsa Douno acquired world publicity
   through a number of publications in newspapers, journals and books.

     * In Italy, Aldo Lavini published a comprehensive biography and research
       on the activities of Master Beinsa Douno in Il Messaggero della salute
       (1927). The Alpha newspaper coming out in [187]Palermo, an organ of
       the Psychological and Experimental Sciences Association called Master
       Peter Deunov a mystic apostle of Christianity in its complete glory.
       In [188]Locarno, the Yoga Publishing House prepared and published nine
       selected lectures translated by the poetess Mara Belcheva where the
       introduction was written by Prof. Ginno Sordelli. Luigi Belloti,
       Director of the Italian Academy of Sciences, Literature and Arts, in
       his speech at the opening of the Academy ([189]24 October [190]1929)
       declared Master Peter Deunov its spiritual leader.

     * Die Gloke journal in the Czech Republic published the biography of
       Master Peter Deunov, and the philosopher Rudolf Burkert called him a
       prophet of the white race in his book Das Reich Gottes auf Erden.

     * The German newspaper Reformblatt published an article titled
       Forerunners of the new culture, where the Universal White Brotherhood
       was commented `The true value of this movement lies not only in its
       ideas, but also in the unflinching power to implement these ideas in
       life.' Master Peter Deunov is presented as a `handsome figure
       breathing kindness.' The German Menschheitspartei movement (1932)
       announced its belonging to the Universal White Brotherhood in Bulgaria
       and its respect to Master Peter Deunov.

     * Agnessa Hofmann, a leader in the Catholic Liberal Church in the
       [191]Netherlands, visited Bulgaria in 1928 and said, `I came to meet
       Master Peter Deunov. Few are the Masters of humankind.'

     * Nineteen lectures of Master Peter Deunov were published in English in
       the [192]USA and they were received with enthusiasm by the press.
       [193]The Rosicrucian Society in [194]Oceanside, [195]California,
       summarized their impressions from the lecture as follows, `The person
       who wrote these beautiful and elevated thoughts, has a profound
       knowledge of the secrets of life.'

     * The Torch journal in [196]Canada, an organ of the astrological
       society, published a response to the Great Law lecture, `By its merits
       this little booklet is second to no other book in the entire American
       rhetoric literature. The author has penetrated deeply into the work of
       the spiritual alchemy of the Universe; he shows how each virtue
       contributes to the construction of the common good of humanity.'

     * The Hejnal journal in [197]Poland published an article of Agni
       Pilshova, `There are many esoteric schools in the world, but the
       school in Bulgaria stands out with something specific. It tries to
       influence and educate society through its good example.'

     * The press in [198]Switzerland published an annotation about Georgi
       Radev's book The Master Speaks (compiled from texts of Master Beinsa
       Douno), `Never have we come across so many truths delivered in such a
       concise form, so lively and brilliantly.'

     * In 1953 in [199]France [200]Mihail Ivanov, one of the most devoted
       disciples of Master Beinsa Douno, known in the west world with name
       [201]Master Omraam Mikhael Aivanhov, founded Fraternite Blanche
       Universelle (The Universal White Brotherhood) in Bonfin, from which
       dozens of spiritual centres started on the other continents during the
       following years. The followers of [202]Master Omraam Mikhael Aivanhov
       practice [203]Paneurhythmy and study especially the `mystic Bulgarian
       language', to be able to sing the musical exercises of Master Beinsa
       Douno in the original.

     * After the democratic changes in Bulgaria hundreds of spiritual seekers
       from all over the planet visit the Annual Meeting near [204]the Seven
       Rila Lakes to take part in the Mountain School established by Master
       Beinsa Douno, and to perform the sacred dance of [205]Paneurhythmy
       together with thousands of spiritual brothers and sisters.

     * In 2005 the official internet site, dedicated to the Word of Master
       Beinsa Douno [206]http://www.BeinsaDouno.org/, started working on a
       multi-language translation project in respect of his literary legacy
       in Russian, German, English, Spanish, French, Polish etc.

  [[207]edit] Attitude of the Orthodox Church to Master Beinsa Douno

   Peter Deunov was born in a family of considerable contribution to the
   Revival of Bulgarian nation and especially - struggle for church
   independence.^[[208]citation needed] During the second decade after the
   Liberation of Bulgaria from the [209]Ottoman Empire he founded a Society
   for the Elevation of the Spirit of the Bulgarian People (1897) where
   prominent figures in the struggle for church independence were members.
   But the bishops in the [210]Bulgarian Orthodox Church did not accept his
   reformist ideas about returning to the principles of the [211]early
   Christianity. According to him the clergy should work for free and
   selflessly, earning their living from their spiritual work among the
   people. On the other hand, his Esoteric-Christian doctrine is based on the
   principles of the cause-result relation and [212]reincarnation (the law on
   [213]reincarnation and [214]karma) with the purpose to improve and elevate
   the human soul ever closer to the perfection of Christ - principles
   contradicting the official church dogmatics. The same is moral principle
   of [215]vegetarianism - the practice in the social life of the Universal
   White Brotherhood.

   During the second decade of 20th century the Bulgarian Orthodox Church
   made direct and indirect, overt or covert attempts to discredit Master
   Beinsa Douno. The principle charge against him was that he identified
   himself with Christ, in spite of his unambiguous speech on [216]8 August
   [217]1920, "Do not look for Christ on the physical level; do not try to
   find Him in one person only, because He is in all people. Moreover, where
   Christ is manifested you will see an intensive light. Christ is one and
   many. Sometimes you say, `Is Mr. Deunov Christ or Christ is in him?' I
   will tell you that I am not Christ, but that Christ is in me. If I were
   Christ, whom you take me for, I would be governing the whole world. But as
   I am not such a person, I am not Christ either. Christ is not in the
   physical world."

   In the spring of 1922 the Bulgarian Orthodox Church campaign against
   Master Beinsa Douno was at its peak. In his Sunday sermon on [218]14 May
   he stated, `If somebody attempts to speak the truth today, the first thing
   he would be called is a heretic... If your teaching yields better results
   I will accept it, but if my teaching produces better results, accept my
   methods.' On [219]18 June Master Peter Deunov said, `Now is the time for
   culture, we are the bearers of a cultural movement, of a cultural tide in
   Bulgaria. And the Bulgarian clergy, is plotting how to impede us, instead
   of working intelligently, benefiting from this blessing sent from Heavens.
   They have to understand that they will impede themselves first of all.' On
   [220]7 July [221]1922 at the Bishopric Council of the Bulgarian Orthodox
   Church Peter Deunov was declared to have self-excommunicated himself, and
   his teaching was declared `heretic and dangerous to the internal peace and
   public moral.' Master Peter Deunov did not comment upon this event, did
   not come out to defend himself in public; he only emphasized the ideal of
   the Great Universal Brotherhood, `Let the Orthodox Church resolve this
   issue, whether Christ has risen, whether Love is accepted in the Orthodox
   Church. There is one church in the world. But the Universal White
   Brotherhood is outside the church - it is higher than the church. But even
   higher than the Universal White Brotherhood is the Kingdom of Heaven.
   Hence the Church is the first step, the Universal White Brotherhood is the
   second step, and the Kingdom of Heaven is the third step - the greatest
   one that is to be manifested.' ([222]24 June [223]1923).

  [[224]edit] Attitude of the Bulgarian Philosophers to Master Beinsa Douno

   The Teaching of Master Beinsa Douno is subject of theological and
   philosophical analysis. In 1917 the theologian Daniil Laskov published a
   couple of articles in the Spiritual Culture newspaper: What is Theosophy
   and The Attitude of the Bible to the Theosophical spiritism and occultism.
   In 1922 his book Peter Deunov and His Teaching came out, where the latter
   was defined as a `sum of pagan superstitions, theosophic spiritism and
   occultism.' In 1929 Angel Tomov analysed the religious and philosophic
   concepts in the teaching in the Philosopher's Review journal. He argued
   that the teaching could be understood only as a component of the mystic
   wave of the new epoch, typical for which is the growing interest in
   spiritism and the advent of theosophy and of various occult schools and
   mystic societies in the world. Later on the eminent remkeist Prof. Dimiter
   Mihalchev published in consecutive issues of the same journal several
   studies, `The Religious and Philosophical Points of View of Peter Deunov'
   (1930) and `Against Danovism as Theosophic Teaching' (1931). According to
   him it all comes down to pantheistic metaphysics sweeping the masses in
   mysticism thus `wasting their potential' in regard to the state and the
   nation. In 1940 Dr Cyril Cholakov, a psychiatrist, a student of Mihalchev,
   published three pieces of criticism in the Mental Health journal,
   qualifying Master Peter Deunov and his thousands of followers in clinical
   terms. All critical analysis from this period aimed predominantly at the
   ideal and religious aspects of the teaching, ignoring willingly or
   unwillingly its Esoteric-Christian basis.

   The Marxist philosophy after 1944 examined Master Peter Deunov as a
   founder of a `specific Bulgarian theosophical teaching' in the bourgeois
   society. His followers were defined as people `deaf and blind for the
   sufferings of the epoch'. Biased scenarios about an alleged `suicide' by
   Peter Deunov were floated, in spite of the existing documentary evidence
   about pneumonia being the direct cause for his death.

   In the late 20th century certain informal philosophic circles in Bulgaria
   proposed a method for structural reconstruction in respect of the
   interpretation of Master Beinsa Douno's texts. In their opinion these were
   structured on a triple dialogue Christ-I-The Other, which made it possible
   to see them internally and to experience them as Word or as a Moral event.
   It is stated that only the structural interpretation makes them
   scientifically distinct from other esoteric or religious texts, since the
   morphology of Christ-I-The Other is not to be found in the Orthodox
   Christian literature, theosophy and Eastern Occultism. Contrary to the
   accusations that Master Beinsa Douno's sermons lacked any structure is the
   so-called musical principle. It is understood as a spiritual practice for
   esoteric disciples where reading and/or listening to the Word
   spiritualises the intellectuality of the contemporary consciousness,
   revives the life of the Cosmic intelligence within it and thus experiences
   immediately what the Master, in the form of the [225]Holy Spirit, performs
   within.

  [[226]edit] Attitude of the Bulgarian State to Master Beinsa Douno and the
  Universal White Brotherhood

   Master Beinsa Douno and the Universal White Brotherhood do not participate
   on principle in any government institutions or political units.
   Nonetheless they were subject to both interest and repressions on behalf
   of politicians, statesmen, parties, the army and the police. There are
   documents, according to which Master Beinsa Douno intended to present his
   Appeal to My People before the National Assembly (1897); he gave up this
   idea later on. From 1912 to 1918 most of his disciples and followers were
   mobilised in the Bulgarian army and at his instructions they carried The
   Good Prayer and Psalm 91 sown in their military coats. On [227]11 November
   [228]1912, towards the end of the [229]Balkan War, through Maria
   Stoyanova, he advised the Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand to sign an armistice
   with Turkey and not to attack his allies. In August [230]1915 during the
   course of the [231]First World War the Tarnovian Military commandment
   dispersed the Annual Meeting of the Universal White Brotherhood and forced
   Master Beinsa Douno to leave the town. After Bulgaria's capitulation at
   Dobro Pole ([232]15 September [233]1918) he advised the Bulgarian Tsar
   through go-betweens to abdicate in favour of his son, Boris.

   On [234]13 July [235]1921 the Bulgarian Ministry of Interior adopted a
   statute of the White Brotherhood Society in [236]Rousse and actually this
   was the first legal registration of the followers of the Universal White
   Brotherhood. In the 1920s Master Beinsa Douno stayed for a long time in
   Sofia at 66 Opalchenska Street, right next door to the home of the
   communist leader Georgi Dimitrov. Memoirs of contemporaries have it that
   the latter hid several times from the police in the house of Master Beinsa
   Douno.

   According to the memoirs of Petko Epitropov in July 1922 Master Beinsa
   Douno met Alexander Stamboliyski, then the Prime Minister, and had a
   private talk with him. On [237]9 June [238]1923 after a coup d'etat the
   party of the Democratic Accord took over; the government of the Democratic
   Accord did not allow the Annual Meeting of the Universal White Brotherhood
   to be held. On [239]21 July [240]1925 Master Beinsa Douno was summoned to
   a hearing at the Public Security Police Department in Sofia; his answers
   to the questions put to him were documented and kept and they represent a
   peculiar manifesto of his [241]ideal doctrine. In 1936 he was attacked and
   beaten by an adherent of the Democratic Accord party; the incident led to
   a brain haemorrhage and paralysis; later on the Master recovered
   completely. Afterwards his attacker asked Master Beinsa Douno for
   forgiveness. On [242]2 October [243]1937 he was officially called to
   answer in written form and in detail questions about the attitude of his
   [244]teaching to the church, the government institutions, the army, the
   social order, marriage, family and moral. His answers were documented and
   preserved for the generations.

   During the [245]Second World War Master Beinsa Douno advised his disciples
   Lyubomir Loulchev (advisor at the court) and Methodi Constantinov (high
   official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) to talk with Tsar Boris III
   about withdrawing his decision on the deportation of [246]Bulgarian Jewry.
   In this way he indirectly became one of the people, who helped stop the
   deportation.^[[247]citation needed]

   Four years after the establishment of the totalitarian communist regime in
   Bulgaria, the Ministry of Foreign Affair recognized the Universal White
   Brotherhood as a `faith community' ([248]23 January [249]1948), but in
   October 1956 repealed its decision. In June 1948 the land plot in Izgrev
   where the prayer meeting hall was located was nationalised, and was given
   to the Embassy of USSR. On [250]6 December [251]1957, by virtue of a
   prosecution order, the entire reference literature with the Word of Master
   Beinsa Douno was seized, and in August 1958 the Sofia City Council
   nationalized all land plots owned by then Izgrev citizens.

   After the democratic changes in Bulgaria, the Council of Ministers adopted
   a statute of the Universal White Brotherhood Society ([252]7 November
   [253]1990), and in 2001 it published a [254]certificate, according to
   which the Society does not qualify as sect; it is an official spiritual
   movement arising in Bulgaria as an original tradition that has lasted over
   a century in Bulgaria.

[[255]edit] Contemporary survey of the work of Master Beinsa Douno

   Originally (during the first half of 20th century) Master Beinsa Douno was
   identified by his disciples and followers as one of then Great Masters of
   the Lodge of the Great Universal Brotherhood. In 1940s Vlad Pashov, Georgi
   Radev, Boyan Boev and Methodi Constantinov were the first to argue in
   their scientific works the central cosmogonic and gnoseological
   significance of the concept of the Great Universal Brotherhood, they
   analysed in detail its macro- and micro-cosmic structure as given by
   Master Beinsa Douno (advanced human souls and nine hierarchies of
   super-sensitive beings under the supreme command of Christ) and defined
   the conscious relation with it as a main cognitive objective in the
   spiritual practice of esoteric disciples. Some Bulgarian publications from
   1990s define him as Universal Master, without linking him with any of the
   existing philosophic, religious or esoteric doctrines so far. The
   prevailing opinion is that his mission was to renovate [256]Christianity
   in relation with forthcoming Slavonic cultural epoch and the future Sixth
   race.

   From 1999 onwards certain informal philosophical circles in Bulgaria and
   the [257]Netherlands, taking recourse to some biographical data about the
   life of Peter Deunov and to spiritual-scientific theses of the
   anthroposophic teaching of [258]Rudolf Steiner, identified Master Beinsa
   Douno as manifestation of the [259]Bodhisattva Maitreya in 20th century
   (for more information download this e-book file [260]"The Teaching about
   the Lodge of Bodhisatva and the Issue of the 20th century Bodhisatva - An
   attempted contemporary reading, new ideas"). From this point of view they
   regard his teaching as the supreme emanation of [261]Esoteric
   Christianity, and the methods of his school - as experiencing practices of
   the so-called etheric coming of Christ in astral level. These
   interpretations are argued against by some leading representatives of the
   Anthroposophic School in Dornach ([262]Switzerland) and although
   Bodhisattva Maitreya is a central object of research in
   [263]Anthroposophy, they have not stated any alternative points of view so
   far concerning the spiritual, historic and personal identification of the
   Bodhisattva Maitreya in 20th century.

   On the other hand, the School of [264]Esoteric Christianity in Dornach is
   examining certain attempts at personification of the Bodhisattva Maitreya
   (Juddi Krishnamurti, Valentine Tomberg, Omraam Mihail Ivannovi etc.) as
   illegitimate attempts to replace his true mission as a messenger of the
   etheric coming of Christ in an astral plan. The spiritual scientific
   dialogue between these two European traditions may be interpreted not only
   as a token of synthesis, but also as a total human union in Christ.
